= Jenkins integration with Kabanero

Learn how to use Tekton to build an image and how to use Jenkins to deploy an application that uses that image.

The following diagram depicts the relationship and flow between Tekton and Jenkins:

image::/img/guide/jenkins-tekton.png[link="/img/guide/jenkins-tekton.png" alt=""]

== Prerequisites
You need the following prerequisites to complete the guide:

// OKD Installation - At the time this guide is written, 3.11 is the preferred version.
* link:https://docs.okd.io/latest/install/running_install.html[OpenShift 3.11]
// Kabanero Foundation
* link:https://github.com/Kabanero-io/Kabanero-foundation[Kabanero Foundation] (cloned)
// Kabanero Pipelines
* link:https://github.com/Kabanero-io/Kabanero-pipelines[Kabanero Pipelines] (cloned)
// Appsody Installation
* link:http://appsody.dev[Appsody] (installed)

See each project's documentation for necessary system requirements.

== Intended audience
This guide is for anyone who has experience with Jenkins and is familiar with the fundamental concepts of microservices, Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift, and Tekton. The purpose of the guide is to show an existing Jenkins user or administrator how to build an image with Tekton and how to deploy an image with Jenkins.

== Build an image with Tekton

=== Create a pipeline
The script to create a pipeline is included with the Kabanero Pipelines project. This template script contains both build and deployment tasks, but you will remove the deployment task from the file so that Tekton performs only the build task.

Go to the `kabanero-pipelines` folder that you recently cloned. Find the `pipelines/incubator/build-deploy-pipeline.yaml` file, and remove the section of the file that is highlighted:

// image::/img/guide/test-build-pipeline.png[link="/img/guide/test-build-pipeline.png" alt=""]
[source,yaml,linenums,highlight=81..90]
----
apiVersion: Tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: CollectionId-build-deploy-pipeline
spec:
  resources:
    - name: git-source
      type: git
    - name: docker-image
      type: image
  tasks:
    - name: build-task
      taskRef:
        name: CollectionId-build-task
      resources:
      inputs:
        - name: git-source
          resource: git-source
      outputs:
        - name: docker-image
          resource: docker-image
    - name: deploy-task
      taskRef:
        name: CollectionId-deploy-task
      runAfter: [build-task]
      resources:
        inputs:
        - name: git-source
          resource: git-source
        - name: docker-image
          resource: docker-image
----

You removed the deployment task. Save and close the file. Rename the file to `test-build-pipeline.yaml`.

In the `test-build-pipeline.yaml` file, update the name of the build task to `nodejs-express-build-task`. The taskRef name must be one of the tasks that is installed in the OpenShift cluster. Then, update the pipeline name to `test-build-pipeline`. After you make these changes, your file looks like following example:

// image::/img/guide/build-task.png[link="/img/guide/build-task.png" alt=""]
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: Tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: test-build-pipeline
spec:
  resources:
    - name: git-source
      type: git
    - name: docker-image
      type: image
  tasks:
    - name: build-task
      taskRef:
        name: nodejs-express-build-task
      resources:
      inputs:
        - name: git-source
          resource: git-source
      outputs:
        - name: docker-image
          resource: docker-image
----

Now, run the following command to create the pipeline:
----
oc apply -f test-build-pipeline.yaml -n Kabanero
----

In the command, the `-n` indicates the Kabanero namespace where the pipeline is created.

=== Create a PipelineRun binary
*Note:* You can use a project of your choice to complete this guide. If you don’t have a project yet, run the `appsody init nodejs-express` command to get a sample Node.js - Express application.

Go to the Kabanero Foundation project that you cloned and open the `scripts/appsody-Tekton-example-manual-run.sh` file. In this file, edit the `DOCKER_IMAGE` and `APP_REPO` parameters to reflect the code repository and image repository of your choice. For this example, use the Docker repository on OpenShift.

Run the following command to create a PiplineRun binary:
----
./appsody-Tekton-example-manual-run.sh
----

Run the following command to see the running PipelineRuns:
----
oc get pipelinerun
----

Run the following command to display the PipelineRun execution steps:
----
oc get pipelinerun -o yaml
----

If the `pipeline-run` command fails at the `validate-collection-is-active` step, remove the `appsody/nodejs-express:<ver>` value and add the `Kabanero/nodejs-express:<ver>` value in the `appsody-config.yaml` file under the Appsody project.

This problem is a known issue for projects that are created by using the `appsody-init` command.

=== Create an image and push it to Docker
Log in to your OpenShift dashboard and select the Kabanero namespace. Navigate to Overview -> Builds -> `<project-name>`, where `<project-name>` is your GitHub project name. You can now see the image that you created.

== Deploy an image with Jenkins

=== Create a Jenkinsfile
Use the Jenkinsfile template from the reference section of this guide, and change the Docker Hub source to your own image repository. Push this Jenkinsfile to your GitHub repository in the root location.

=== Create a deploy file
On your local environment where Appsody is installed, go to your project folder and run the following command to generate an `app-deploy.yaml` file:
----
runappsody-deploy –-generate-only
----

Other tools, including Jenkins, can use this file for application deployment. Commit and push this file to the root of your project. Jenkins creates the `AppsodyApplication` resource in the OpenShift cluster and uses Appsody to deploy the application by using `app-deploy.yaml` file.

=== Create a Jenkins project and pipeline
Create a Jenkins (Ephemeral) instance from the OpenShift Catalog. Create a project and specify GitHub as the source. Provide your GitHub account and repository details and choose multi-branch pipeline creation. Jenkins automatically detects the Jenkinsfile in your GitHub repository and starts the deployment process.

=== Verify deployment
Go to Application -> Deployment in your OpenShift portal to see the successful deployment. You can also see the URL of running application by going to Application -> Deployment -> Routes.

== Reference
* The following file is a sample Jenkinsfile that you can use to set up your initial Jenkinsfile for the guide:
----
podTemplate(label: 'label', cloud: 'openshift', serviceAccount: 'appsody-sa', containers: [
    containerTemplate(name: 'kubectl', image: 'lachlanevenson/k8s-kubectl', ttyEnabled: true, command: 'cat')
  ]){
    node('label') {
        stage('Deploy') {
            container('kubectl') {
                checkout scm
                sh 'sed -i -e \'s#applicationImage: .*$#applicationImage: docker-registry.default.svc:5000/Kabanero/project1#g\' app-deploy.yaml'
                sh 'cat app-deploy.yaml'
                sh 'find . -name app-deploy.yaml -type f|xargs kubectl apply -f'
            }
        }
    }
}
